# Searcher
can search for email or number from copied text from clipboard using regular expression.

HOW IT WORKS :

1. You copy a bunch of texts from which you want to search for urls       emails or numbers.

2. Next when you launch the program or run the code it automatically catches the copied texts and search for the information.

3. Finally it shows if any email phone or url exists in the text and displays it. 

4. It also automatically copies it to clipboard so that you dont have to copy it.

NOTE : You can try copying whole search_alg.txt to check it.


HOW TO RUN :

Goto or download and open dist folder and open searcher.exe 

If you have pyperclip module and python you can directly run searcher.py
